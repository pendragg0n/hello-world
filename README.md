A new adventurer into modding.
Never created a mod, I'm not really here to do so. Yet I won't count it out if I get to a place where I feel comfortable with my knowledge level.
I am an Information Resource professional, and I've been designing & building systems for 25 yrs, I have not been overly active for about five years I know that is a couple lifetimes in the technology cycle).
*I mainly came to have access to mods unavailable on Nexus, as well as having a good source of 'clean' files.*
Seeing how modders create and the implementation of their ideas into code interests me.
I look forward to learning about modding and mod implementation.
# *I welcome meeting people.*
Tho, please forgive any/all delays in responding as I may not get back immediately.
